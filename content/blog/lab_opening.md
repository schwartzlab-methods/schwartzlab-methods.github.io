The lab is opening in October! Join our team to help develop new methods and
algorithms to help us understand treatment-resistance in cancer and create new computational
tools to improve diagnosis and guide therapy. We are accepting applications for
all levels, from graduate student to postdoctoral fellow, as well as software
engineers and bioinformaticians.
